/* Minimal stub for gnu/stubs-lp64.h
 * This file is provided so that including system headers that expect
 * <gnu/stubs-lp64.h> won't fail in a freestanding / cross compile setup
 * where the full glibc multi-arch headers are not installed.
 *
 * NOTE: This is a workaround for test/build environments. Prefer installing
 * the correct cross-libc headers/sysroot or configuring --sysroot for the
 * cross-compiler in the long term.
